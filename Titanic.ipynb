    "# 3 Pandas tricks every Data Scientist should know\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to the world of data science, Python's Pandas libraries are some of the best tools for quick data analysis. Pandas are built on Numpy, another popular Python libary. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide 3 tips and tricks with plenty of practice examples that should be part of your tool kit as a Data Scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will use data from one of the most infamous shipwrecks, the sinking of the RMS Titanic. You've almost certainly heard stories about the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 when it hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage. Astonishingly, there were not enough lifeboats available for all the passengers. This tragic tale got even more interesting and personal when I found out that one of my friend's great-grandfather was on the Titanic. It get's worse - he was the helmsman! Two facts that most people seem to remember are.\n",
    "1. The women were given preference to the lifeboats over the men and as a result many more survived.\n",
    "2. Those in first class were given access to the lifeboats over those in other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will have access to a subset of the data and confirm these facts for yourself. \n",

You are now left with 733 entries from the original 891 - a definite improvement on 183 with dropping any rows with missing values. Modify the line above to confirm this is the case. Dropping missing values isn't a good option here. Let's try another of Panda's options, filling the missing values.\n",

Apply functions can be particularly powerful when we combine them with lambda expressions. \n",
